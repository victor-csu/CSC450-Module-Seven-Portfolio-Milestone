PROGRAM Thread Counters
-	Multithreaded concurrent program that counts up to twenty and down to zero.

BEGIN
    BEGIN
        Define an "count_to_twenty" function that counts up to twenty using a loop.
        The "count_to_twenty" takes a single parameter, a reference to a global count variable
        Print the result of each increment
    END

    BEGIN
        Define an "count_to_zero" function that counts down to zero using a loop.
        The "count_to_zero" takes a single parameter, a reference to a global count variable
        Print the result of each decrement
    END

    BEGIN
        Define a "thread_runner" function that takes the following parameters:
        - name: the thread's name
        - thread_function: the function to execute within the thread
        - count: a reference to a global count variable
        - thread_lock:  a mutex lock to control access to the global count variable
        The "thread_runner" function should execute the "thread_function" and control access to the shared count variable.
    END

    Define a "main" method.
        The main method should execute the "count_to_twenty" function using the "thread_runner" in a separate thread.
        The main method should execute the "count_to_zero" function using the "thread_runner" in a separate thread.
        Both thread should run concurrently and the "counter" global variable state should be valid at the end.
END
